# A motivating example for higher-kinded types in Rust

This crate defines an incomplete set of traits that could be used to define a
zipper-like abstraction for arbitrary graphical structures in Rust. The rustdocs
explain how the lack of a particular form of higher-kinded types makes this
difficult. They may be browsed at
